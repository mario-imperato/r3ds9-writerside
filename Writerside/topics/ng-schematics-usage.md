# NG Schematics usage

### Use the schematics in an angular project

This schematics is not published as to speak. To use it in an Angular project it can be linked from the angular project with the
`npm link` command with the relative pathname from the angular project to this project home. The command has to be issued in the
angular project root directory. In my test case I used: `npm link ../r3ds9-schematics`.
This command creates a sym-link in the `node_modules` directory.

## Adding a Schematics

In the project folder run the command `schematics blank --name=NAME-OF-SCHEMATICS` (i.e. `schematics blank --name=types`).
This will create a folder under `src` with the name `NAME-OF-SCHEMATICS`.
In the new folder create a file `schema.json` with this initial content (note: types is NAME-OF-SCHEMATICS).
This will provide information on the type of params accepted by the schematic.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$id": "FormSchema",
  "title": "Form Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "path": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "path",
      "description": "The path to create the component.",
      "visible": false
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "$default": {
        "$source": "argv",
        "index": 0
      }
    },
    "project": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name of the project.",
      "$default": {
        "$source": "projectName"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

In the `collection.json` add the reference to the just created schema file:

```
"schema": "./NAME-OF-SCHEMATICS/schema.json"
```

The `collection.json` now should look like:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/collection-schema.json",
  "schematics": {
    "r3ds9-schematics": {
      "description": "r3ds9 schematic.",
      "factory": "./r3ds9-schematics/index#r3ds9Schematics"
    },
    "types": {
      "description": "a schematic to create typescript data beans",
      "factory": "./types/index#dtoModel",
      "schema": "./types/schema.json"
    }
  }
}
```

Now in the NAME-OF-SCHEMATICS folder run `npx -p dtsgenerator dtsgen schema.json -o schema.d.ts`.
The first time might ask to install a dependency. Now you have a `schema.d.ts` file with the definition of a Schema Object.
In the last run it gave me:

```
Need to install the following packages:
  dtsgenerator@3.19.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y
```

Open the `index.ts` file and change the rule entrypoint from

```
export function types(_options: any): Rule {
```

to (note: `TypesSchema` is the interface created using `types` as the NAME-OF-SCHEMATICS)

```
export function types(_options: DTOModelSchema): Rule {
```

Every time the `schema.json` is changed, re-run the generator to keep the typescript aligned.

### Testing2

To run a test against a schematics use a command like this from terminal or add to the scripts in package.json
In the example dto-model is the current schematic

```
npm run build && jasmine src/types/*_spec.js
```

### Schema.json

A few notes on the schema.json file

- The options on the command line have to be provided dasherized: that is if you have an option named onConflict, then, on command line should be provided as --on-conflict [camel case arguments are no longer allowed](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/23548)
- On the other side, options in the schema.json are better off to be defined in camelCase for typescript reasons. Apparently names with `_` gives problems in the matching with command line processing (didn't completely sort out the issue)
- There are a number of predefined __$source__ to use to initialize the params; below few relevant cases: `workingDirectory` path is set to the working directory (relative to the project path, i.e. `src/app/...` ), `argv` for some positional information in the command line, `projectName`
  to initialize the value to the name of the project....

```json
    "path": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "path",
      "description": "The path to create the objects.",
      "visible": false,
      "$default": {
        "$source": "workingDirectory"
      }
    },    
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "$default": {
        "$source": "argv",
        "index": 0
      }
    },
    "project": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name of the project.",
      "$default": {
        "$source": "projectName"
      }
    }
```

### Using schematics

To use a schematics the typical invocation would look like the following (to be invoked from inside an angular project)

`
ng generate r3ds9-schematics:types path/to/the/dto/<dtoName>
`

where the base name as to be provided together with the relative path (this somewhat depends on the location of command issued)

### Artifacts location resolution

Since schematics is a matter of code generation, there is the need to determine from the input params where to create the expected artifacts.
The Logic is in the `shared/util/location.ts` file and is invoked in the `index.ts`:

```ts
const workspacePathInfo =  await getWorkspacePathInfo(_context, tree,  _options.project);
const fileLocation = getLocation(_context, workspacePathInfo, _options.path as Path, _options.name);
_options.name = dasherize(fileLocation.name);
_options.argv_path = fileLocation.path;
_options.path = fileLocation.path || '';
if (!_options.flat) {
  _options.path = join(_options.path as Path, _options.name);
}
```

The `workspacePathInfo` in general is something like `src/app` (might be different in multi project workspace). At the end options.path is set to the actual location where to put the stuff...

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

### Publishing

To publish, simply do:

```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```

That's it!
